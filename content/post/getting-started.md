This is the first post included in my home page. I already have a [personal blog](http://jelabra.blogspot.com.es/), so I am not sure if I will really use this place. 

Anyway, who knows...it seems quite easy to create posts here using the [Academic theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
